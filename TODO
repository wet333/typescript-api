# TODO

· Implement the builder pattern for making new endpoints, so i can add new features to each endpoint in the future

· Make a real secret for the sessions

· SQL script runner

    i want to make something that runs all SQL scripts i have in a folder in order, and each file runs as a single 
    transaction so it fails and rollback if something didint go well. I will need to keep track of the already 
    sucessfully runned scripts.
